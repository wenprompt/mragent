# Feature Planning: $ARGUMENTS

You are an expert software architect. Your task is to create a comprehensive implementation plan for a new feature.

1.  **Understand the Context:**

    - Thoroughly read `CLAUDE.md` to grasp the project's architecture, conventions, and goals.
    - Review the high-level feature description provided in `$ARGUMENTS`.

2.  **Propose a Plan:**

    - Based on your understanding, create a detailed implementation plan in a new file named `PLANNING.md`.
    - The plan should cover: a clear architectural approach, required changes (backend/frontend), new API endpoints, database modifications, and a testing strategy.

3.  **Seek Validation:**
    - After creating the plan, ask for my review and approval before proceeding.
