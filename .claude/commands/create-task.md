# Task Breakdown from PLANNING.md

You are a senior developer and project manager. Your task is to convert a high-level plan into a detailed, actionable task list for the development team.

1.  **Read the Plan:**

    - Carefully read and analyze the approved `PLANNING.md` file in this directory.

2.  **Generate Task List:**

    - Create a new file named `TASK.md`.
    - Break down the implementation plan from `PLANNING.md` into specific, granular, and actionable tasks.
    - **Structure the tasks:** Group them logically (e.g., by Backend, Frontend, Database).
    - Evaluate the complexity of the task, and if it is too complex, split the task into sub tasks.
    - **Use Checkboxes:** Each task must start with a markdown checkbox (`[ ]`).
    - **Clarity is Key:** Ensure each task is a clear, single action that can be verified and marked as complete.

3.  **Final Confirmation:**
    - After creating `TASK.md`, list the new file and ask for my confirmation to begin implementation.
