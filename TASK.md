- [ ] Implement query result caching where appropriate
- [ ] Add proper error handling for database operations

---

## Phase 7: Development Environment Setup

### 7.1 Local Development Preparation
- [ ] Add appropriate logging for sandbox management operations
- [ ] Add logging for context building operations
- [ ] Implement development-friendly error messages
- [ ] Add console logging for debugging context flow

### 7.2 Deployment Preparation
- [ ] Create database migration script for production
- [ ] Verify all environment variables are properly configured
- [ ] Test deployment process in staging environment (if available)
- [ ] Update `CLAUDE.md` with new iterative development capabilities

---

## **üõë MANUAL TESTING CHECKPOINT**

**The following tasks require manual testing and user validation before proceeding:**

### Phase 8: Manual Testing & Validation ‚ö†Ô∏è **REQUIRES USER INTERVENTION**

#### 8.1 Functionality Testing
- [ ] **USER TASK:** Test single message project creation (verify existing functionality still works)
- [ ] **USER TASK:** Test iterative development workflow manually (create project, then add features)
- [ ] **USER TASK:** Verify sandbox reuse works across multiple messages
- [ ] **USER TASK:** Test context preservation across user interactions
- [ ] **USER TASK:** Verify AI agent receives proper context from previous messages

#### 8.2 Edge Case Testing
- [ ] **USER TASK:** Test behavior when sandbox becomes unavailable/expired
- [ ] **USER TASK:** Test performance with projects that have many messages
- [ ] **USER TASK:** Test projects without previous context (new projects)
- [ ] **USER TASK:** Verify backward compatibility with existing projects

#### 8.3 Performance Validation
- [ ] **USER TASK:** Monitor message history query performance during testing
- [ ] **USER TASK:** Check response times for sandbox creation vs reuse
- [ ] **USER TASK:** Validate context building performance with various message sizes
- [ ] **USER TASK:** Report any performance issues discovered

---

## **Phase 9: Post-Testing Tasks** ‚ö†Ô∏è **CAN ONLY START AFTER PHASE 8 COMPLETION**

## Implementation Notes

### Development Approach
- Follow existing project patterns and conventions
- Use existing tools and libraries (Prisma, tRPC, Inngest)
- Maintain backward compatibility throughout
- Implement phases 1-7 can be done independently
- **Phases 8-9 require user involvement and cannot proceed automatically**

### Key Files to Modify
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Add new Project fields
- `src/inngest/functions.ts` - Enhanced code agent function
- `src/prompt.ts` - Dynamic prompt generation
- `src/inngest/sandbox-manager.ts` - New sandbox utilities
- `src/inngest/context-builder.ts` - New context system
- `src/inngest/utils.ts` - Additional utilities

### Success Criteria for Phases 1-7
- [ ] All code compiles without errors
- [ ] Database migration runs successfully
- [ ] No runtime errors in development environment
- [ ] All new modules and functions are properly implemented
- [ ] Existing functionality remains unbroken at code level

### Success Criteria for Phases 8-9 (User-Dependent)
- [ ] Users can iteratively improve projects through conversation
- [ ] Sandbox resources are reused efficiently
- [ ] AI agent maintains context consistency across messages
- [ ] No regression in existing user-facing functionality
- [ ] Performance remains acceptable for user workflows

## Development Workflow

1. **Complete Phases 1-7** - These can be implemented independently
2. **Request User Testing** - User needs to manually test the implementation
3. **Wait for Testing Results** - Cannot proceed until user validates functionality
4. **Complete Phase 9** - Fix issues and finalize based on testing feedback

This structure ensures clear separation between what can be automated vs what requires human validation.
